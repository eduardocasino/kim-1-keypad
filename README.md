# KIM-1 Keypad

## About

Welcome to the KIM-1 Keypad repository.

I designed this board for [my KIM-1 PCB replica](https://github.com/eduardocasino/kim-1), but it will also work with real KIM-1s from Revision D and onwards.

WARNING: I have not yet sent the board to fabrication, so it is untested!
